## About Me ðŸ“–

I thrive on learning new topics and creating things that have a positive impact on society. Efficiency and optimization are my mantras, whether that's learning keyboard shortcuts or creating smart workflows. I love working in teams of skilled people, whether in full-stack or front-end roles. My experience spans IoT technology to creative pursuits like music, video editing, writing, drawing, and photography.

## Greatest Strengths ðŸ’ª

- **Efficiency**: I'm obsessed with optimizing my workflows and always try to find ways to do more in less time.
- **Attention to Detail**: Whether it's code quality or the nuances in a video edit, I always make sure no detail is overlooked.
- **Passion for Learning**: My daily routine includes absorbing new knowledge, from technology trends to creative techniques.

## Projects In Progress ðŸš€

### Wrd - The Rebus Puzzle Game

Wrd is an iOS application born from a collaborative project that I spearheaded along with two classmates. It's an engaging rebus puzzle game that leverages CoreData for its persistent storage needs. The app has a variety of categories, each housing a unique set of puzzles designed to challenge and entertain users. Player progression is tracked, unlocking new levels upon reaching specified milestones. The game incentivizes players with 'brains' â€” a virtual currency awarded for correct answers â€” which can be used to purchase hints. For those eager for more immediate assistance, hints can also be acquired via in-app purchases. For us, Wrd is a project for sharpening our programming skills and trying to launch our projects into the world. Therefore, we plan to submit the application to the App Store in April 2024.

#### Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** Swift
- **Back-end:** CoreData
