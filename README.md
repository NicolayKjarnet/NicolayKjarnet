# Hi there, I'm Nicolay! 👋
I'm a Creative Developer at Cavai, where I conceptualize, design, and code interactive advertising campaigns. Additionally, I freelance as a content producer for various clients including Universal Music Norway, and I'm co-running the company Kjærnet-Wesseltoft, where we're currently developing an interactive kitchen design platform.
