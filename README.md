## About Me üìñ

I thrive on learning new topics and creating things that have a positive impact on society. Efficiency and optimization are my mantras, whether that's learning keyboard shortcuts or creating smart workflows. I love working in teams of skilled people, whether in full-stack or front-end roles. My experience spans IoT technology to creative pursuits like music, video editing, writing, drawing, and photography.

## Greatest Strengths üí™

- **Efficiency**: I'm obsessed with optimizing my workflows and always try to find ways to do more in less time.
- **Attention to Detail**: Whether it's code quality or the nuances in a video edit, I always make sure no detail is overlooked.
- **Passion for Learning**: My daily routine includes absorbing new knowledge, from technology trends to creative techniques.

## Projects In Progress üöÄ

### Greenhouse Monitoring System

A greenhouse monitoring solution utilizing an Arduino ESP-32 device to transmit live environmental data to an MQTT broker, subsequently stored in MongoDB. This system updates every ten seconds, providing real-time insights into temperature, humidity, and light levels directly on the user's desktop or phone through interactive graphs. It features an alert mechanism via the PushSafer API to notify users of any parameter deviations beyond set thresholds. The system is designed for scalability and can be expanded to monitor multiple greenhouses simultaneously.

#### Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** React TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ApexCharts
- **Middleware:** PlatformIO, Arduino, C++
- **Back-end:** Node.js, MongoDB, Express

### Wrd - The Rebus Puzzle Game

Wrd is an iOS application born from a collaborative project that I spearheaded along with two classmates. It's an engaging rebus puzzle game that leverages CoreData for its persistent storage needs. The app has a variety of categories, each housing a unique set of puzzles designed to challenge and entertain users. Player progression is tracked, unlocking new levels upon reaching specified milestones. The game incentivizes players with 'brains' ‚Äî a virtual currency awarded for correct answers ‚Äî which can be used to purchase hints. For those eager for more immediate assistance, hints can also be acquired via in-app purchases. For us, Wrd is a project for sharpening our programming skills and trying to launch our projects into the world. Therefore, we plan to submit the application to the App Store in April 2024.

#### Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** Swift
- **Back-end:** CoreData

## Academics üéì

In my final semester at Kristiania University, collaborating on a project aimed at enhancing the user experience of the Wolve Loyalty Platform. So far, we've conducted a detailed market analysis, market segmentation, and qualitative interviews with representatives from our target audience. Based on the results, we're currently developing a high-level prototype of the new platform in Figma. Following user testing, our next phase involves bringing the vision to life by coding the solution in Vue Typescript.

## Continued Learning üìö

With the tech industry evolving rapidly, I set a personal goal in January to dedicate at least thirty minutes each day to learning through Udemy courses. This daily practice has significantly improved my proficiency across a broad range of skills and has spiked my passion for learning new skills and technologies even more.

## Portfolio Update üåê

My portfolio is currently undergoing development and will be upgraded to Next.js in the coming weeks. The existing site is an experimental project inspired by Apple's interactive scrolling webpages. It has not been coded with a mobile-first approach and is therefore best viewed on a desktop for the time being. The scrolling concept from this site is planned to be repurposed for a different project in the future.
